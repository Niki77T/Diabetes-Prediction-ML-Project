# Diabetes-Prediction-ML-Project
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide. Early prediction can help in better management and prevention.  

This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on medical measurements such as:
glucose level, BMI, and blood pressure and pregnancies.
Outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)
It includes importing libraries, EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis),data cleaning -preprocessing,splitting data,model building and evaluation and finally saving model in joblib for future use.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:
â€¢	Python | Pandas| Scikit-learn  | Matplotlib | Jupyter Notebook | joblib
ðŸ’¡ Objective:
To predict diabetes risk using machine learning and health data, enabling early detection and better healthcare decisions.
ðŸ§  Model:
â€¢	Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier
â€¢	Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

ðŸš€ How to Use:
1.	Clone the repo.
2.	Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt.
3.	Run the Diabetes_Prediction_Model.ipynb notebook to test the model with sample data.
